# Heavymetalion

Title: Heavy Metal Ion Prediction in Water Using Machine Learning

Developed and Implemented Machine Learning Models:

Designed and implemented predictive models in a Jupyter Notebook to forecast the presence of heavy metal ions in water samples.
Utilized machine learning algorithms, such as Random Forest, Support Vector Machines, and Neural Networks, to analyze water quality data and predict heavy metal concentrations.
Data Analysis and Visualization in Jupyter Notebook:

Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) on water quality datasets to identify patterns and correlations related to heavy metal ion levels.
Created interactive visualizations using libraries like Matplotlib and Seaborn in Jupyter Notebook, enhancing data interpretation and model insights.

In this project :

Applied K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm in machine learning to predict heavy metal ion concentrations in water, leveraging diverse datasets collected from various websites and papers.
Demonstrated proficiency in data synthesis and model implementation, enhancing predictive capabilities for water quality assessment.
